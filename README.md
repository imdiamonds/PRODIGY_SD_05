The aim of this project is to
Create a program that extracts
product information, such as names,
prices, and ratings, from an online e-
commerce website and stores the
data in a structured format like a
CSV file.

(I utilized the Books to Scrape website (http://books.toscrape.com/) as a practical and ethical testing ground for the web scraping code. This website serves as a demonstration platform explicitly designed for individuals to practice web scraping techniques. By adapting the script to the HTML structure of the Books to Scrape website, I successfully extracted product information, including names, prices, and ratings. This hands-on testing on a sandboxed environment allowed me to refine and validate the functionality of the code in a controlled and responsible manner. It's essential to note that when applying similar techniques to real-world scenarios, obtaining proper authorization and adhering to the terms of service of the target website is crucial to ensure ethical and legal compliance.)

To adapt the web scraping code for different websites, you'll need to modify specific parts of the script to match the HTML structure of the target site. Here are the instructions on what to change:

URL of the E-commerce Website:
Replace the e_commerce_url variable with the actual URL of the e-commerce website you want to scrape. For example:

python
Copy code
e_commerce_url = 'https://www.example-ecommerce-site.com/'
HTML Tags for Product Information:
Update the HTML tags used in the find_all functions to match the structure of the target website. Inspect the HTML of the website and identify the tags that contain the product names, prices, and ratings. For instance:

python
Copy code
# Find product information (replace these with actual HTML tags of the website)
product_names = soup.find_all('h2', class_='product-title')
product_prices = soup.find_all('span', class_='price')
product_ratings = soup.find_all('div', class_='star-rating')
CSV Output File Name:
If you want to change the name of the output CSV file, modify the output_file parameter in the save_to_csv function:

python
Copy code
save_to_csv(scraped_data, output_file='target_website_data.csv')
Remember to thoroughly inspect the HTML structure of the target website using browser developer tools (usually accessible by right-clicking on the webpage and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"). Make sure to comply with the website's terms of service, and if the website provides an API, consider using it for data extraction instead of web scraping.
